If you have decided, that you want your assets back before the lock duration expires, there is an option to "Force withdraw" your KYO.

This can be done on [koyo.finance/lock](https://koyo.finance/lock) page.

To be able to force withdraw your assets, you must first have your wallet connected to Kōyō Finance. however we won't go through the connect wallet process as we already did in [Lock](http://localhost:3000/protocol/guide/Locker/Lock#connect-your-wallet) section of the guide.

Are you really sure you want to do this?

## Penalty

_Beware that force withdrawing your assets will result in a 80% loss. You will get only 20% of your locked KYO back, other 80% will be burned._

## Withdrawing

If yes, than you should see a red "FORCE WITHDRAW" button.

By pressing "FORCE WITHDRAW" button a popup/modal should appear, asking you if you are sure to force withdraw them.

By pressing "FORCE WITHDRAW" in the modal, a transaction confirmation is going to open up in your wallet.

When you confirm the transaction and it goes through successfuly, you should see the 20% of your locked KYO appear in your wallet.
