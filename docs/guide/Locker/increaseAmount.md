Once your locker is created you have an option to lock more KYO into it.

You do that on [koyo.finance/lock](https://koyo.finance/lock) page.

To be able to increase amount in your lock, you must first have your wallet connected to Kōyō Finance. however we won't go through the connect wallet process as we already did in [Lock](http://localhost:3000/protocol/guide/Locker/Lock#connect-your-wallet) section of the guide.

The "Lock KYO tokens" window looks a bit different now that your locker actually exists. It should look something like that.

You can see the stats about your current locker are shown. The amount of KYO you have locked and end of the lock period.

## Setting amount

This works exactly like setting the amount to create a locker. You type the amount into an input and that's it.

Beware that if you try to deposit more amount of KYO than you have, transaction will fail and you'll lose the money you paid for gas.

## Adding amount

After you have chosen a desired amount of KYO you just press "ADD AMOUNT" button and transaction will start.

You should confirm the transaction to pay the gas fee and your deposited amount is going to be added to your locker.

## Problems
