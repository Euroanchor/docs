Kōyō Finance allows you to vote for the gauges you've deposited in. By voting for gauges, they'll claim more emissions, which will result in larger KYO prizes. Your voting power will be determined by how much veKYO you own.

First you'll have to navigate to the Vote page [koyo.finance/kyo/gauges](https://koyo.finance/kyo/gauges).

## Setting vote weight

Once you've selected the gauge, you should set the vote weight to delegate to the selected page.

You set the weight on the input field that has "0 %" as a place holder and a "MAX" buttn on the right. By clicking on the "MAX" button, you delegate a 100% of your vote power to the gauge.

## Claiming emissions

Once the gauge you've voted for and also have deposited LP tokens into it, starts claiming emissions, you can claim them in the table above a gauge selection button.

You can claim emissions that the gauge has claimed by pressing the claim button which has an amount of KYO claimable displayed on it.
