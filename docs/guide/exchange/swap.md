One of main functions of Kōyō Finance is swaping your tokens.

We currently support only four stable coins from our 4pool:

-   Tether USD
-   USD Coin
-   FRAX
-   DAI Stablecoin.

Swapping process on Kōyō Finance is very simple and straight forward.

We start by navigating on [Kōyō Finance Swap](https://koyo.finance/swap).

![Kōyō Finance Swap page](/img/guide/swap/swapPage.png)

By default the selected tokens are:

-   Swap from: DAI Stablecoin
-   Swap to: FRAX

We have an option to select tokens. Clicking on a current token will open a modal.
