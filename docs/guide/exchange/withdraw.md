When you want to get your deposited assets back, you can always withdraw them.

You're in luck, because the process of withdrawing your assets on Kōyō Finance is very simple.

You can make a withdraw on [koyo.finance/withdraw](https://koyo.finance/withdraw).

## Choosing a pool

First you are presented with the selection pool screen.

Clicking on "CHOOSE LIQUIDITY POOL +" button will open a modal, where you'll see all **availible pools** on Kōyō Finance.

To choose the pool, just **click on the desired pool** shown in the pool list.

If you maybe changed your mind and want to withdraw your assets from a different pool, you can click on the "Switch liquidity pool" button, which will be displayed after you've first selected the pool.

## Connect your wallet

If your wallet is already connected, the "WITHDRAW" button will be shown, so you can skip this and proceed to [Withdraw](#Withdraw). Otherwise you will be presented with "Connect Wallet" button, which will allow you to connect your desired wallet to Kōyō Finance.

When you choose a wallet, your wallet application will most likely open your wallet or account and ask for **confirmation to connect** to Kōyō Finance.

Second "Connect Wallet" button is always shown in **top right** of the page (desktop) or in the **navigation** (mobile).

## Choosing amount

Once you have selected the desired pool, you want to set the amount of each token, you want to withdraw.

Depending on the chosen pool, you should see something similar to what you see on the picture down below. For this example I am using the 4pool.

### LP tokens

Above the tokens you can see your LP balance in the pool. LP tokens can be exchanged for real tokens from the pool. Beware that withdrawing those tokens will lower your position in the pool itself.

Choosing the amount is just a matter of typing in the amount of any token you want to withdraw.

<img src="/img/guide/swap/withdraw-chooseamount.png" alt="set amount" width="700" />

We can see that a little window has appeared. It says "LP tokens burned: 11.99114", which means that by withdrawing the amount of tokens we entred, we burn a certain amount of our LP tokens for the chosen pool.

(_You can withdraw any amount of any token, as long as the entered amount isn't higher than the amount of LP tokens you own_).

## Withdrawing

Withdrawing is done just by clicking on the "WITHDRAW" button and approving the gas fee in your wallet.

Enjoy your freshly transfered assets.
