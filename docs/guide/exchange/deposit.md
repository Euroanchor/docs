Let's take a look of **depositing** process on Kōyō Finance.

You can deposit your assets on _[koyo.finance/deposit](https://koyo.finance/deposit)_

## Selecting a pool

First you are presented with the selection pool screen.

Clicking on "CHOOSE LIQUIDITY POOL +" button will open a modal, where you'll see all **available pools** on Kōyō Finance.

To choose the pool, just **click on the desired pool** shown in the pool list.

If you maybe changed your mind and want to deposit your assets into different pool, you can click on the "Switch liquidity pool" button, which will be displayed after you've first selected the pool.

## Setting amount

Once you have selected the desired pool, you want to set the amount of each token, you want to deposit.

Depending on the chosen pool, you should see something similar to what you see on the picture down below. For this example I am using the 4pool.

### Balance

If your wallet is connected the **balance** of tokens is displayed underneath each token.

### Token amount

Setting the amount is just a matter of typing in the amount of any token you want to deposit.

<img src="/img/guide/swap/deposit-amountSet.png" alt="set amount" width="700" />

There are no rules to depositing. You can deposit any amount of only one token or all of them, doesn't matter if you deposit 100 of first token and 0,2 of the other tokens. Deposit any amount of any token you wish.

## Connect your wallet

If your wallet is already connected, the "DEPOSIT" or "APPROVE - _[token name]_" button will be shown, so you can skip this and proceed to [Deposit](#deposit). Otherwise you will be presented with "Connect Wallet" button, which will allow you to connect your desired wallet to Kōyō Finance.

When you choose a wallet, your wallet application will most likely open your wallet or account and ask for **confirmation to connect** to Kōyō Finance.

To use Kōyō Finance, you have to be on **Boba Network**.

Second "Connect Wallet" button is always shown in **top right** of the page (desktop) or in the **navigation** (mobile).

## Deposit

When you have chosen the pool, amount of assets and connected your wallet, you can deposits the chosen amount of assets.

### Approving

You should see "APPROVE - _[token name]_" button, if not skip this and go to [Depositing](#depositing). In our case it says "APPROVE - _FRAX_".

<img src="/img/guide/swap/deposit-approve.png" alt="Approve" width="550"/>

After clicking on the button, your wallet should open and ask for confirmation of **one-time transaction fee**. Once you pay the fee for the specific, you can deposit only this token as many times as you wish- When you pay for all the tokens. In my case I am using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as my wallet.

_Once you confirm the fee, click back into the application or click on approve button again but **DO NOT** confirm the fee again. It may take a few seconds for the approval (5-20 sec)._

### Depositing

After you have confirmed the transaction, the button now says "Deposit".

Clicking on the button will once again open your wallet and ask you to approve the gas fee, so that the transaction can go thruough and you'll get your LP tokens successfuly.

## LP tokens

By depositing assets in th pool you recieve **LP tokens**. LP tokens represent your position in the pool and will earn you

That's it! You now have your LP tokens that represent your poition in the pool (_you can withdraw them at any time_).
