## Pool types

When creating a pool you have 3 types of pools to choose from:

-   Weighted pool, which allows you to have up to 8 tokens and each one can have a custom weight
-   Oracle pool, which allows you to choose only 2 tokens, but still allows you to set custom weihts
-   Stable pool, which allows you to have up to 8 tokens, but not costum weghts for each token
